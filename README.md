# Total Overdose researching project. (work in progress)

This project includes:
* working hook for the game with basic classes, got by researching game's exe. w.i.p.
* tools to research game's files - currently only 'database.bin' scripts database decoder is present, w.i.p.

I'm using IDA Pro with HexRays decompiler and a lot of patience.
